# PONG-TIME
Pong game with Time display updated by the internet

I asked GPT to create the game and step by step had it troubleshoot by providing the errors from Arduino
It would fix each and resupply the code

TRICK 1
When it gives you code, it will typically truncate the result. Just ask GPT to continue where it left off, then it will continue

If you want to add new features, just supply the code to GPT by cut/paste with the request before copying the code in

Happy computing
